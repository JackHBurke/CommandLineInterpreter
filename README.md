# This program is an attempt to replicate the functionality and appearance of bash; the command line interpreter on linux systems. Functionality includes execution of library functions (i.e. ls, cd, etc.) as well as I/O redirection. Recently included the ability to use pipes, and exit through ctrl-c through cbreak mode.

# To run: execute make with supplied make file, and run executable cmi
